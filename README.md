# Processing-of-genomic-data
  This repository is created  for Compressed genomic data and searching.Created by Clion, used C++!
# Introduction
  This project is a spcial and beautiful idea proposed by prof. JingYing Wang and Zizhao Wang. 
# Method
  1. we used a special invert index and Memory storage technology, a Cache-like technology;
  2. We proposed a beautiful method that can compressed DNA data;
  3. We proposed a algorithm that can accurately and quickly search the string including similarity search.
# Algorithm
# Install
# use it in your computer
